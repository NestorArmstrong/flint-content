# The Market’s Most Dangerous Moment: When Bears Become Bulls 

The most dangerous moments in markets seldom feel scary. They actually feel rather calm, confident, and reassuring. This happens due to the fact that just before all market crashes the skeptics simply give up. Investors who once warned about risks stop resisting the rally. 

So how could this be a bad sign? Sure, prices may keep rising, but fewer new buyers are entering. Gains are now driven by optimism and momentum rather than by solid foundations. And when something unexpected happens, everyone will stampede towards the exit at once.

In economic markets, warning signs are emotional, not technical:

- *“This time is different.”* 
- *“This time is different.”*  
- *“This time is different.”*  

Hearing any (or all) of these phrases tossed around doesn’t mean that you should panic right away. You should, however, pay close attention. Because when fear disappears, risk usually hasn’t… it’s just being ignored.

Market crashes don’t begin with panic. 
They begin with complacency.

### When skeptics grow comfortable and bearish voices go quiet, it’s often not a sign of strength, but one of fragility.
