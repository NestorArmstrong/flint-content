# Market Madness: Why Sitting Still Might Be Your Best Move

Over the course of the past weeks, we’ve experienced some turmoil in the market. Analysts, traders, and investors alike are scrambling to make sense out of the insanity that has taken over asset prices. Politicians, on the other hand, seem hell-bent on breaking any sense of stability of trade and peace with their fear-mongering speeches. 

So what should you do amidst all this _mayhem_? 

Truth is, although it’s not impossible to predict where the market might head sometimes, it’s certainly impossible to know for how long the pendulum will swing to either side. COVID was an excellent example of this. 

The deadly COVID outbreak brought a 35% drop in value on virtually all assets of the market. This downturn was more than justified, taking into consideration a once-in-a-lifetime plague that brought the modern world to its knees. No one, however, expected that the economic conditions would bounce back as quick as they did: a 60%+ rally in the mere time expanse of just a handful of months. 

Most of those who played the timing game during COVID got badly burned. On the other hand, those who held on through the whole ordeal fared much better. 

You don’t need to react to every little thing that happens, or act upon every little bit of news that comes your way. Inaction is also a valid course of action (despite the grammatical paradox). 

For the past 100+ years, time in the market has always given better results than timing the market. Presidents have come and gone. Empires have risen and fallen. Global economies have prospered and collapsed. 

**If your time horizon is long enough into the future, today’s price fluctuations will most likely be just small droplets in a sea of growth.** 

So rather than worrying about where the economy will be in the next three days, a better question(s) might be: where will it be in the next 3, 5 or even 10 years? What sectors/companies are most likely to come out on top? What sort of needs might arise in that modern world?

Although it’s a bit difficult to picture a non-negative outcome for the time being, I whole-heartily invite you to shift your perspective over to the long term. Short term is a fool’s game. Long term is the place where true wealth is created.
