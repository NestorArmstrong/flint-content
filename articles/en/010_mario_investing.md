# How Super Mario Bros. Could Make You a Better Investor

As a kid who grew up in the 90’s, I can assure you there was no greater joy than waking up in Christmas morning and find your new Nintendo Entertainment System sitting under a tree. My console came with two games: Rad Racer and Super Mario Bros. And although by modern standards this game could be considered overly simplistic and linear, it holds a certain charm and a very powerful lesson within its 40 Kilobytes of code. 

I’ll be the first to admit I’m no video game expert, nor did I have any ambition of going pro when I first held that thick beige controller at four years old. Even now, some levels still give full-grown adults a hard time. But what fascinates me is how kids back in the day, despite countless pitfalls, deaths, and frustrating jumps, never lost heart.

The game was unforgiving. Step on the wrong tile? You’re dead. Touch a turtle? Dead. Caught by a rogue fireball? Dead. Run out of lives? You’re sent all the way back to the dreaded **Game Over** screen.

But here’s what was truly remarkable: despite all of these obstacles and scenarios where the odds were stacked against us, we never relented or said: “_Maybe I’m just bad at videogames!_”

We didn’t spiral into doubt or shame. We didn’t swear to never play again. We simply hit the restart button… and tried again.

So if we can effectively become resilient warriors when it comes to jumping on goombas, why can’t we be the same on our daily lives? Why, when an investment doesn’t go as planned, do we crumble into self-pity, doubt, and despair? Why do we overanalyze and convince ourselves we’re one of the worst traders/investors on the planet and maybe we should quit altogether? 

Stop. Ask yourself a better question: why don’t you just try again?

Some will argue that a game can’t be compared to real life. But maybe that’s the whole issue. We carry enormous weight on our real-world failures and allow them to define us. If only we applied the simple truth we learned decades ago: press restart and try again, maybe more people would pursue their dreams instead of numbing themselves with cheap dopamine escapes.

Don’t allow a bad month, a bad quarter, or even a bad year define who you are. Remember: the tools are there, the lessons are there, and resilience is already inside you.

So next time you fall, just dust yourself off… and try again. Because that’s what winning, both in life and in Mario Bros., is all about.
